<p>
    There are times when you want to manipulate and item that is passed into a method rather than one you have loaded from the Sitecore 
    database, good examples of this are the Sitecore workflow and pipelines. 
</p>
<p>
    In this tutorial we will create a sort to sort the the events we created in the last tutorial. The current order of our event
    items are shown below:
</p>
<img src="tutorial09.itemspresort.PNG" class="img-polaroid"/>
<p>
    These items are not sorted by Start date, we will create a sub-item sorter to ensure that the items are listed in Start
    date order. Our comparer  logic is very straight forward:
</p>
<pre class="github cs" file="docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial09/tutorial09.sortorder.cs" ref="gh-pages"></pre>
<p>
    The GlassCast method allows you to convert a Sitecore item to a specific type loaded by the default Glass.Mapper context. Data is 
    read directly from the item and not by going back to the database first. It also has a matching extension method called GlassRead 
    that allows you read properties from a class back onto the item.
</p>
<p>
    Now that we have our sort method we just need to define our compare item in Sitecore:
</p>
<img src="tutorial09.sortitem.PNG" class="img-polaroid"/>
<p>
    Finally we just need to update the Subitems Sorting field on the standard values field of our Events Folder template:
</p>
<img src="tutorial09.subitemsortingfield.PNG" class="img-polaroid"/>
<p>
    Now if we look at the order of our events we can see that they have reorganised themselves into the correct order:
</p>
<img src="tutorial09.itemspostsort.PNG" class="img-polaroid"/>
<p>
    In this tutorial you have seen how you can convert an item into a strongly typed object without having to request it from the 
    Sitecore database.
