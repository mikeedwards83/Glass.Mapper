<p>
    Sometimes you might not want to create a model, you might just want to render data out quickly. This is where the 
    dynamic keyword support comes in. The dynamic support allows you to pull data directly from Sitecore without a model, 
    the easier way to explain this is to see it in action.
</p>
<p>
    I have created a new sublayout called Metadata which will be used to contain the data I want to rendering in the head
    section of the page. The code behind for the sublayout uses the GlassUserControl but takes the keyword dynamic:
</p>
<pre class="github cs" file="docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial10/tutorial10.metadata.ascx.cs" ref="gh-pages"></pre>
<p>
    My ascx markup looks like this:
</p>
<pre class="github cs" file="docs/tutorial/sitecore/tutorial10/tutorial10.metadata.ascx" ref="gh-pages"></pre>
<p>
    In the markup you can see we are pulling the items Title and the Updated fields. To render these fields in the background
    they are sent through the FieldRender control, you don't have to worry about this but it does mean that Rich Text
    fields will have links updated correctly.
</p>
<p>
    Next we set the canonical Url by calling the Url property, you can actually get more metadata about an item than this
    by using the enum values on the <a href="/docs/api/Glass.Mapper.Sc.Configuration.SitecoreInfoType.html">Glass.Mapper.Sc.Configuration.SitecoreInfoType</a> type.
</p>
<p>
    The dynamic item also supports navigating up and down the tree by using the Parent and Children properties. The Parent
    property will return another dynamic type and the Children will return and IEnumerable&lt;dynamic&gt;. 
</p>
<p>
    If we look at the source of our page we now get some metadata with minimal effort:
</p>
<pre class="xml">
    &lt;title&gt;Events&lt;/title&gt;

    &lt;metadata name="updated" content="03/03/2013 11:39:56" /&gt;

    &lt;link rel="canonical" href="http://sitecore.glass.com/Events.aspx" /&gt;

    &lt;link rel="prev" href="http://sitecore.glass.com/" /&gt;


    &lt;link rel="next" href="http://sitecore.glass.com/Events/2013.aspx"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>
    Dynamic items are great when you just want to get data our of Sitecore with minimal effort. You can find out more about
    dynamic support by reading the 
    <a href="/docs/api/Glass.Mapper.Sc.Dynamic.DynamicItem.html">Glass.Mapper.Sc.Dynamic.DynamicItem</a>
    documentation.
